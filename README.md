# btd_deconv
A deconvolution approach for functional neuroimaging data to jointly estimate HRFs and source signals

This package reproduces the results of the paper titled "Deconvolution of the Functional Ultrasound Response in the Mouse Visual Pathway Using Block-Term Decomposition" by Aybüke Erol, Chagajeg Soloukey, Bas Generowicz, Nikki van Dorp, Sebastiaan Koekkoek, Pieter Kruizinga and Borbála Hunyadi (currently under review).

All codes are written in MATLAB. Tensorlab should be installed for running the codes (https://www.tensorlab.net).
